I am building a healthcare platform called CuraCal designed to streamline the process of booking appointments with trusted doctors and managing healthcare records. The platform offers users a convenient, user-friendly interface where they can browse doctors by specialty, book appointments, and access personalized health reminders. It aims to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by offering efficient, seamless, and accessible services. With features like secure health data management, appointment tracking, and a responsive design, CuraCal enhances the healthcare experience by providing transparency, convenience, and ease of use for both patients and healthcare professionals.
